## Step 4: Deploy Your Website to Kubernetes
Kubernetes Deployment:  
Create a website-deployment.yaml defining a Deployment that uses the Docker image created in earlier.  
Ensure the Deployment specifies the necessary environment variables and mounts for the database connection.  
Outcome: The e-commerce web application is running on Kubernetes, with pods managed by the Deployment.

## Step 5: Expose Your Website
website-service.yaml to create a Service of type LoadBalancer.  
 This Service exposes your Deployment to the internet.
Outcome: An accessible URL or IP address for your web application.
