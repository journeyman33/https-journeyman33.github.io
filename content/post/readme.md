I once suggested using civo on a new project and was immediately dismissed in favour of aws. A civo managed kubernetes cluster costs less than half of the the price of the three hyperscalers EKS, AKS and GKE. So, I get to try it out now. 

I am not sure what he meant by "might not have all the features"

## Describ3 the Task

Imagine you are going to deploy an e-commerce website. Itâ€™s crucial to consider the challenges of modern web application deployment and how containerization and Kubernetes (K8s) offer compelling solutions:

Scalability: How can your application automatically adjust to fluctuating traffic?
Consistency: How do you ensure your application runs the same across all environments?
Availability: How can you update your application with zero downtime?
Containerization, using Docker, encapsulates your application and its environment, ensuring it runs consistently everywhere. Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform, automates deployment, scaling, and management, offering:

Dynamic Scaling: Adjusts application resources based on demand.
Self-healing: Restarts failed containers and reschedules them on healthy nodes.
Seamless Updates & Rollbacks: Enables zero-downtime updates and easy rollbacks.
By leveraging Kubernetes and containerization for your challenge, you embrace a scalable, consistent, and resilient deployment strategy. This not only demonstrates your technical acumen but aligns with modern DevOps practices.
